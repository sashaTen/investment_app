 production ready sentiment analysis project  : 
 --system that is robust, scalable, and efficient
 --data  load ->  preproceess  
 --model  train  ->   exprerement -> eval -> hyperparams 
 --pipeline  automaition 
 --api  with  django -> dockerization 
 --Monitoring: Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance in production
  (accuracy, response time, user feedback).
-- ci  :  Automate the testing and validation of new code
--Automatically deploy new model versions or updates to production
--Model Monitoring  accuracy, precision, and latency in production.
--Drift Detection: Implement mechanisms to detect model drift (when the model starts to degrade in performance).
--Retraining and Updating: Set up automated retraining pipelines that trigger when new data or model drift is detected.
