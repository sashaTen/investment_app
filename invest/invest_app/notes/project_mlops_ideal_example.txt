level  0   : 
ml  aside  from  ops   
only  developing the   model

level 1  : 
automaition
It ensures that the model can automatically 
retrain with new data, 
making predictions continuously 
and adjusting to changes over time.


Fast Experimentation: You can try 
different approaches and 
models quickly because the whole process 
(like data preparation, training, and testing) is automated. 
If one model doesn’t work well, you can easily switch to another.
for  ex :  you  may  have   the  hypothesis  that  the  new  model 
should   be  tested   on  new  data .    

Automatic Training in Production: 

Once the model is in production (the real-world environment), 
it can retrain itself automatically when it gets new data.


Reusable Components: The parts of the pipeline 
are modular, meaning they can be reused for 
different models. For instance, if you have 
several models, you don’t need to build everything 
from scratch each time; you can reuse 
components like data processing steps.


Extra Components:
Data and Model Validation: 
The pipeline automatically checks if 
the new data and models are valid 
and makes sure everything works 
before deploying the model.
Feature Store: A place to store 
and reuse important features 
(like customer information or product details)
 that are used to train the models.
